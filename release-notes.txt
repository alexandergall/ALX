Release Notes for 16.09.ALXpre81125.838e976

The l2vpn application has been updated to Snabb version v2017.07,
which includes new drivers for Intel NICs.

Changes incompatible with previous releases

   * The device templates formerly located in /etc/nixos/devices has
     been moved to the nixpkgs tree to subject it to the regular
     upgrade mechanism.  After upgrading to this release, the
     statement

       imports [ ./devices ];

     must be removed from /etc/nixos/l2vpn.nix and the directory
     /etc/nixos/devices can be deleted.  The now built-in devices list
     can be overriden by a configuration like the following, if needed

       config.services.snabb.devices = {
         advantech = {
           FWA3230A = {
             interfaces = mkOverride 0 [
             ## Complete list of customized interfaces
             ];
           };
         };
       };

   * The option enableInboundND in the IPv6 address family
     configuration of an interface has been removed.  This feature is
     now always enabled.


New features

   * Per-direction port-mirroring is supported for all networking
     devices.  Packets can be copied either to a Tap interface or a
     file in pcap format.
