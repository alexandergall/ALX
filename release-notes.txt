Release Notes for 15.09.ALX.17.b282d5c

Note: this release includes changes to the configuration of
/etc/nixos/l2vpn.nix that are incompatible with previous releases.
The configuration needs to be adapted to the new version after an
upgrade.

The interface configurations have been separated from the VPLS
configuration.  The configuration now includes L2-properties (MTU, MAC
address, VLAN trunking) as well as L3-properties (address-family
specific configuration, currently limited to IPv6).

Any physical port can now optionally be configured as a VLAN trunk.
In that case, sub-interfaces are created for each VLAN allowed on the
trunk.  Each sub-interface can be configured either as a L2- or
L3-port like a physical interface.

The VPLS configuration now includes just a reference to the name of a
(sub-)interface for uplinks and attachment-circuits.

It is now possible to disable the control-channel for a specific
pseudowire when the default control-channel is disabled.
