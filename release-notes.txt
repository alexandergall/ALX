Release Notes for ALX.9.9ae440d

This release introduces support for the Intel 1GE NIC models i210 and
i350.  The driver is selecetd by the following configuration in
/etc/nixos/l2vpn.nix for an uplink interface or an attachment circuit:

  driver = {
    path = "apps.intel.intel1g";
    name = "Intel1g";
  };

The default control-channel for pseudowires can now be disabled by
specifying

  defaultControlChannel = { enable = false; };

in the configuration section of a VPLS instance.  Note that it is
currently not possible to disable the control-channel for a particular
pseudowire if the default control-channel is enabled.  To mix
pseudowires with and without control-channels in a VPLS instance,
disable the default control-channel as shown above and enable it
specifically for the pseudowires for which it is desired.

The release also contains the following bug-fixes

  - l2vpn
    Multiple VPLS instances now work as expected instead of
    crashing the service

  - SNMP subagents
    The subagents are now started after the l2vpn application
    to satisfy a dependency on the presence of the directory
    where the shared memory segments where the application is
    storing the SNMP objects for the agents.

  - SNMP daemon
    The daemon is now started after the "network" systemd target
    to avoid spurious errors at boot time
