Release Notes for 16.09.ALXpre81128.e020e67

New features

   * Support for authentication via TACACS+

     When enabled, logins via ssh are authenticated against the
     configured TACACS+ server without the need to create local
     per-user accounts. Instead, users are mapped to pre-configured
     accounts based on their privilege level. Users with privilege
     level 15 are mapped to the account "tatacs15", all other privilege
     levels are mapped to the account "tacacs0". The user tacacs15 is
     configured to have full sudo privileges. The sudo command has been
     modified to query the TACACS+ server for the credentials of the
     original user name.

     The service is enabled by setting the "enable" option to "true" and
     providing the IP address and shared secret in the file
     /etc/nixos/tacacs.nix, e.g.

     users = {
       tacplus = {
         enable = true;
         server = "192.0.1.1";
         secret = "someSecret";
       };
     };
