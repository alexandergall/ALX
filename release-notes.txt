Release Notes for 15.09.ALX.26.2f82246

This release contains a fix for a bug related to the population of the
pwEnetTable/cpwVcEnetTable MIBs.

The L2VPN application no longer waits for the links of physical ports
to come up before startup is completed.  This allows the system to
start properly irrespective of the states of the ports, e.g. if the
remote side is down.
