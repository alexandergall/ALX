Release Notes for 18.09.ALX.1017.0cea7a11d30

New features

   * Complete fate-sharing of l2tpv3 data- and control-channels

     The control-channel for a l2tpv3-based tunnel used to use
     fixed cookie values of all zero bytes.  In case of a cookie
     mismatch on the data-channel, this lead to the operational
     status to be set to "up" even though the tunnel was not
     working.  The control-channel now uses the same cookies as
     the data-channel to reflect the mismatch in the operational
     status.

   * Enable option per VPLS instance

     Each VPLS instance can now be selectively disabled with

     vpls = {
       foo = {
         enable = false;
       };

     This is equivalent to removing the entire section from the
     vpls configuration.

   * Trigger worker process restart when a JIT option changes

     Any changes in the "luajitWorker" attribute set a l2vpn
     instance configuration will restart the corresponding worker
     process to pick up the changes

Bug fixes

   * The previous release introduced a bug that causes the
     interface counters of any sub-interface to show values
     of zero
