Release Notes for 18.09.ALX.1031.04074ac6648

This release provides an improvment of the semantic validation of the
configuration.  It fixes most instances where an error in the
configuration caused an abnormal termination rather than a
human-readable error message.

It also contains code that allows the systemd service that manages the
initiation of IPSec SAs to detect when an instance of a L2VPN service
is restarted and requires re-initiation of the SA.
