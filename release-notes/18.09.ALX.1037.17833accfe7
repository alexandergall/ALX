Release Notes for 18.09.ALX.1037.17833accfe7

New features

   * Manager process exits if a worker process dies.  This allows
     systemd to restart the application.

   * Support vplsGenericMIB/cvplsGenericMIB. This provides a mapping
     of pseudowires to VPLS instances.  Given the name of a VPLS
     instance, a monitoring process can find all attached pseudowires
     and check their status.

Bug fixes

   * Crash in corner-case of IPv4 reassembly
