Release Notes for 18.09.ALX.1021.0a177fa9e1d

This is a pure bugfix release.

   * Properly support multiple tunnel protocols on the same
     transport. In previous releases, mixing GRE and L2TPv3 on the
     same transport would lead to an assertion failure.

   * When an interface, which is part of the configuration, is not
     referenced by a VPLS either as uplink or attachment circuit, it
     is connected to traffic sinks to drop all incoming packets.  In
     some cases, the sinks were not connected correctly, leading to an
     assertion failure.
